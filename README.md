## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this project i focused more on how to work with Javascript as this was my first project with it and now i know how to better manage DOM elements.

### Continued development

As i focused more on the Javascript part, i can see a lot of ways on improving it, as well as push myself further on stlying the CSS
